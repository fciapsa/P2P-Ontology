# P2P-Ontology
This project aims to provide an ontology represented using DAGs and accompanied with the necessary functionality to run on a P2P distributed network. Its development is part of a series of Bachelor final projects proposed at Universidad Complutense de Madrid under the direction of Dr. Simon Pickin.

The initial version was outlined by Jorge Boticario Figueras (2021) and Flavius Abel Ciapsa (2022) started working on the continuation.
